//! This module contains the definition of the [`ForestOp`] type that encapsulates the possible
//! modifications made to a tree, as well as the concept of a [`TreeBatch`] of operations to be
//! performed on a single tree in the forest. This is then extended to [`ForestBatch`], which
//! defines a batch of operations across multiple trees.
