//! This module contains the definition of [`Storage`], the backing data store for the SMT forest.
//!
//! The forest itself is designed to be storage agnostic, and provides the minimum set of operations
//! for reading and writing to the storage backend. It is intended that very little logic should
//! reside in the storage itself. The primary documentation for those both using and implementing
//! the traits in this module can be found on [`Storage`] and [`StoredTreeHandle`] themselves.
//!
//! # Performance
//!
//! Having an arbitrary `S: Storage` does not give you any performance guarantees about the forest
//! itself. To that end, reasoning about performance should always be done in the context of a
//! concrete instance of the storage. Please see specific implementations for details about
//! performance.

// STORAGE TRAIT
// ================================================================================================

/// The backing storage for the large SMT forest, providing the necessary methods for reading
/// from and writing to an arbitrary storage structure while allowing the forest itself to be
/// storage agnostic.
///
/// # Storage Structure
///
/// The forest's data is physically split into two parts, though this division should not be visible
/// to clients of the forest.
///
/// 1. **Guaranteed In Memory:** This portion of the forest, consisting of some number of levels
///    from the top of each stored tree is guaranteed to reside in memory.
/// 2. **Arbitrary Storage:** The remainder of the forest's data is stored in a place that makes no
///    guarantees as to where it is stored (e.g. in memory, on disk, and so on).
///
/// It is the latter portion that is managed by an implementation of [`Storage`], which will know
/// nothing about the portion of the data guaranteed to reside in memory. Merging the data from the
/// two to create a coherent forest is the responsibility of the forest implementation itself.
///
/// **Note that** the forest may choose to retain no portion of the forest as guaranteed to be in
/// memory. This means that storage implementations must be **agnostic** to the portion of the tree
/// that they store. At a minimum they could store the leaves, and at the maximum they could store
/// the entire tree.
///
/// # Transactions
///
/// Many implementations of [`Storage`] will need to use transaction-based operations to ensure
/// consistency for the data in the case of crashes. To that end, the trait provides functionality
/// for working with transactions as follows:
///
/// 1. Request a transaction to start by calling [`Storage::begin`].
/// 2. Perform any number of operations on the individual persisted tree states in the forest by
///    using [`Storage::tree`] as an interface to do so.
/// 3. Request that the transaction end by calling [`Storage::commit`].
///
/// While this workflow is an inherent part of the trait, not all backends will support the use of
/// transactions for atomicity. A purely in-memory background, for example, will likely perform its
/// reads and writes eagerly. This means that a client of a [`Storage`] implementation, namely the
/// SMT forest, **must not make assumptions** about **_when_ and _in what order_ data is written to
/// disk**.
///
/// - It is recommended that any **storage that does support transactions** guard operations on
///   there being an active transaction. Not doing so risks subtle, programmer-induced data
///   corruption.
/// - For **storage that does not support transactions**, it is recommended to set
///   `TransactionHandle = ()` for clarity. Nevertheless, it must support calling [`Storage::begin`]
///   and [`Storage::commit`] without raising an error.
///
/// This ensures that the forest that uses the storage can assume the existence of transactions and
/// use them properly, regardless of the actual transaction support enabled by a given backend. If
/// they are supported they will be used, and if they are not there is no harm done.
///
/// # Interior Mutability
///
/// This trait is designed to take advantage of the _interior mutability_ pattern, allowing anybody
/// with a standard reference to the storage to mutate it. This is to support a reasonable interface
/// that can be employed from parallel contexts, while also supporting a wide array of potential
/// concrete storage implementations.
///
/// As a result, **care must be taken** to ensure the correctness of any given storage
/// implementation, as the type system is less able to assist the programmer with its correctness.
///
/// # Errors
///
/// All methods are intended to handle potential storage errors by returning the trait's [`Result`]
/// type. Suggested errors are documented for each method, but these may be changed by any concrete
/// implementation of the trait.
